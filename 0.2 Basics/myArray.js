//FIRST METHOD OF DECLARING AN ARRAY
var superHeroes = []; //initialized as an empty array that should only contain strings
var favFoods = [];
var favNumbers = []; //initialized as an empty array that should only contain numbers
superHeroes.push('Superman');
favFoods.push('Rice');
favNumbers.push(7);
//SECOND METHOD OF DECLARING AN ARRAY
var powerLevel = []; //initialized as an empty array that should only contain numbers. Works the same way as the first method
powerLevel.push(9000);
//THIRD METHOD USING TYPE ALIASES
var newUSer = [];
newUSer.push({ name: 'Sadiq', email: 's@gmail.com', isActive: true });
//FOURTH METHOD USING THE ARRAY OBJECT
var coordinates = [
    [10, 20],
    [30, 40],
    [50, 60],
];
console.log(coordinates);
