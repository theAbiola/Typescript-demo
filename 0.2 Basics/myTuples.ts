//tuples mean that we can define an array with a fixed number of elements and types
//Being fixed means that the input data must follow the order of the types and the number of elements in the tuple
//For example, if we define a tuple as [string, number, boolean], the input data must follow this order and have exactly 3 elements
//The three elements must be a string, a number and a boolean in that order


let myData: [string, number, boolean] = ['Habib', 1, true]; //This is a tuple
